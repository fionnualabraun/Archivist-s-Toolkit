This is an (extremely brief) overview of how LLMs can be used as a 'cog' to assist in digital history work.

They can do some pretty cool things, like finding topics and reading emotion in texts. I often found the payoff wasn't worth the pain, but who know, maybe it will be helpful in working with a huge amount of files!

So, I give you all my notes and attempts to make LLMs work...
