**Ben Marwich** -- has created a way to code in R that allows you to package all your work in what he calls a 'research compendium' that gives information about both the data and the packages that were used to complete the analysis.

Can suggest that something that McDaniels is doing is introducing a bit of friction to the process of analyzing historical documents, particularly online: similar to how drawing and the feeling of drawing would be different than just photographing the same scene. 
- When you keep track of what you've been doing, scholars can come back and say 'we already knew that' but if you have a notebook of what's been done, you can say 'we already knew some of this, but we didn't know it could be done this way'
- Paper trails are more important now that computers can write complete sentences -> can prove your work isn't AI generated because you can show how you were thinking about things
### But...
If we're keeping track of our source data, there will be times when things break (digital fail). It can be helpful to think about the way things break ahead of time, through a framework.

If we keep track of the ways we fail, then people who are in a position to make these things public (positions of authority, job security) can then shift the idea of what's possible for academics. Provide a **taxonomy of fails.** Failures aren't weaknesses -- it's more like a postmortem, and you could build it into the process of doing history: could this result in better scholarship? I think so! Look at Ryan Cordell's postmortem of his own project for a thoughtful way to do this https://ryancordell.org/research/VT-database-fail/

When you do this, the failures themselves provide an opportunity for study. For example, looking at LLMs to boil it down to how they fail.
## Useful Things:
Sourcery: A way to request pictures from the archive from someone who is currently there or has been there and photographed what you wanted before https://sourceryapp.org
Claude.ai: Will write code for you if you give it a specific prompt like "generate a template for use with github pages; the template is to make a datapage for a csv file in the same repo..." start small with this, and then ask it to add on little features like a histogram.
