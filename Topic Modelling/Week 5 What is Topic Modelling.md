Can use to create correlations between different data and visualizing it in a variety of ways.
- Unsupervised machine learning algorithm -> put a bunch of data into the computer and it looks for patterns, correlations, but it doesn't look at anything to do with causality
- Unsupervised -> the machine learns on its own without human feedback
Imagine you have a whole bunch of buckets with different aspects of antiquities crime -> each bucket deals with a different thing, like cheating in sports, theft, etc, and there are words that are used to describe these different types of crime in each of these buckets. The words may be used in more than one bucket, but with different frequencies. Topic modelling decomposes documents into their constituent buckets.

Huge potential for understanding discourses over time, pulls up patterns where scholars might not have anticipated them. **It's not necessarily about proving anything, but about changing the way you're looking at the issue or finding new potentials/possibilities.**

It's always good practice, when you are topic modelling, to write down what you think you're going to find beforehand. 
"Given what I know about this material, this is what I think is likely to emerge."
So that when stuff comes out, you have something to react against, and also to prove that you've learned/done something new with the data.

It's not always apparent what the topic means, or how many subtopics might be hidden inside of it. You can extract more topics to get more words and figure this out more easily. 
#### Something Interesting: 
Thinking of different topics as networks, can use this to connect topic modelling to some of the network building that we looked at last week. Play with this more. #idea 

It's not about truth: it's about forming what we know about a topic and taking a large-scale look at it. Don't decry what you find as truth! Just as a way of seeing things.

#### Issues with stemming: Sometimes the topic model will just give you the 'stem' of a word (i.e. 'wom' for woman) and then you have to figure out what the stem means. You can also remove all the 'stop words' like if, or, as, etc.
