OCR tools for assessing handwriting are ever-changing and often seem to require a baffling number of logins, permissions, and accounts. I played around with Microsoft Azure for a bit, and it was decidedly unhelpful.

I've had much more luck with Qwen2-VL-7B, which sounds horrifying, but stay with me.

Now, go ahead and drop an image, and in the question box, tell it to read and transcribe the text in the image. Then run it!

If you want to get fancy, you can make the prompt more complicated. For example, if the text is in another language, it will provide a decent translation!

You can also ask it to read something that is typewritten or handwritten, and it will take this into account.

Another tool you could maybe give a try (although I haven't had much success with it in the past) is PaddleOCR. Here's a Google Colab notebook that should allow you to play around with it:
