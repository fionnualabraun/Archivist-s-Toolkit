# Archivist-s-Toolkit
Created as a toolkit of appropriate (and working) digital history tools for archivists looking to digitalize files. 

All these tutorials were adapted from a set of tutorials put together by Shawn Graham and pulled from The Programming Historian as well as a few other sites and in-class discussions from the Digital History Graduate Seminar at Carleton. 
They've been put together as a toolkit for archivists to remove the potential frustrations of using broken code or programs that no longer work in the digitalization process.
Feel free to use whatever strikes your fancy!
